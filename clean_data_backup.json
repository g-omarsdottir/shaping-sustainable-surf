    "question": "What materials are commonly used for building sustainable surfboards and fins?",
    "answer": "<h2 class=\"\">Recycled EPS Foam:&nbsp;</h2><p>This replaces the traditional polyurethane foam, which has a higher environmental impact during production. Recycled EPS foam uses pre-consumer or post-consumer waste, reducing reliance on virgin materials.</p><h2 class=\"\">Cork:</h2><p>This lightweight and naturally buoyant material can be used as a deck layer or incorporated into the rails of a surfboard for added dampening and a unique aesthetic.</p><h2 class=\"\">Bamboo:</h2><p>Can be used on top of recycled EPS foam for a strong, lightweight, and fast-growing sustainable alternative.</p><h2 class=\"\">Wood:</h2><p>For an even more natural ride, hollow wood can be a sustainable alternative, offering excellent glide ability without fiberglass or EPS foam. Reclaimed wood or fast-growing bamboo are ideal choices to minimize negative or detrimental environmental impact.</p>",
