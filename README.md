### Colors

The website's colors are inspired by the ocean and the beach. The main color of the website is the blue #57a7b3 used in the website logo.

![colors](/documentation/colors.png)

A complimenting colorpalette with the website logo's color was created by [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/palette/57a7b3/3d757d/b35794/7d3d67/b3a357). To keep the overall layout sleek and avoiding visual clutter, the complementing colors were mainly used as accents in box-shadows and for pseudo-class hover effect.

The font color is a warm tone of black and background color is white, which make a very good match for accessability, readability and contrast while being easy on the eye.

## Project planning

### Database Schema

This project leverages a serverless PostgreSQL database for efficient data management. A well-defined Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) (see below) was created upfront to guide development. This approach minimizes database complexity and streamlines the development process, reducing the need for future modifications and debugging. Each model within the project directly corresponds to a table in the ERD, ensuring a clear and consistent data structure.

#### Technical Architecture

**Technical Design:** Separation of concern was implemented by dividing key components into individual Django Models (see ERD). This allows for simple and reliable queries based on the primary key, as well as easy management and scalability.

Relationships between the model fields are indicated with relationship lines on the ERD.

**Model-Based Design:** The principles of separation of concerns are adhered to by employing distinct Django models for each key system component (see ERD). This promotes code clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

**Relational Data Modeling:** The ERD effectively visualizes the relationships between models and model fields, fostering the construction of streamlined and efficient database queries utilizing primary keys.

#### Key Features

**Product Management:** The custom models facilitate the storage and management of individual product entities in the products app.

Products are stored in one model. Categories and Subcategories are stored in separate models, which allows for scalability and streamlines further technical design. 

Choices for the Category and Subcategory models are defined as constants within the models. This guarantees consistent terminology throughout the application, enhancing user experience and simplifying search queries.

This approach simplifies the models for the shopping and purchase process, as well as allows for code consistency in code, by referring to products in all html template by the name product, while assuring a separation of concerns and explicitness.

Superusers (store owners) are granted comprehensive permissions within the application, allowing them to efficiently manage content across the platform. These permissions encompass creation, update, and deletion of product data, and pricing adjustments.

![ERD Product model](/documentation/erd-product.png)

![ERD Product model constants](/documentation/erd-product-constants.png)

**Ecommerce Functionality**

**Discount Codes:** The custom model facilitates the storage and management of individual discount codes in the cart app. The model is used to validate the code and apply the discount to the shopping cart. To ensure the code is valid, the model checks if the code is in the database, and if the code is in the database, if the code is currently active. As precaution, the model and the form are placed in the shopping cart app to allow the form to be submitted to check for validation without interfering with the order form in the checkout app.<br>

Superusers (store owners) are granted permission to create, update, and delete discount codes, as well as manage settings to activate or disable discount codes temporarily.

**Relationship with Order model:** The Order model includes a foreign key to the DiscountCode model, allowing for easy access to the discount code applied to the order.<br>

![ERD DiscountCode model](/documentation/erd-discount-code.png)

**Order Management:** The model Order stores all necessary information for a store order. The model OrderItem associates the products with orders. The models are placed in the checkout app<br>  

Superusers (store owners) are granted permission to view and add new orders, as well as editing essential order details post-purchase, including contact information, delivery addresses, and discounts applied. This flexibility is particularly useful for correcting errors or accommodating changes requested by customers.<br>

Non-Editable Order Items: For security and integrity, the individual items within each order are presented inline but are marked as read-only. This prevents accidental modifications to the items ordered.<br>

These extensive permissions empower superusers to maintain and optimize the application's functionality, ensuring smooth operations and customer satisfaction.

The model OrderItem associates the purchased products with orders. Furthermore, it stores the product name and price at the time of order in case of changes in product name, price or if a product is deleted to maintain data integrity of the order history. These values are passed to the model in the checkout view.

**Integrated Payment Processing:** The system facilitates secure online transactions for product purchases by integrating with Stripe, a payment gateway provider. This ensures a seamless and secure user experience during checkout.

**Relationship with Product, DiscountCode and UserProfile models:** The Order model establishes relationships with the models Product in app products, DiscountCode in app cart, and UserProfile in app profiles (see ERD). This facilitates data retrieval and management of purchase history for both users and store administrators.

![ERD checkout](/documentation/erd-checkout.png)

**Payment Security**

**Stripe Integration:** By leveraging Stripe's secure payment infrastructure, the application safeguards sensitive financial information during transactions. This ensures user trust and adheres to industry-standard security protocols.

**Data security Measures** 

**CSRF Protection:** To safeguard against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, the application enforces the use of CSRF tokens in all forms using the POST method. This bolsters data integrity and prevents unauthorized actions.

**User Management**

**Django Allauth Integration for User Management:** User authentication and authorization are implemented by leveraging the Django Allauth, a third-party library that upholds robust security practices. This provides a robust and secure foundation for user access control.

**UserProfile model:** The UserProfile model is used to store user data. This includes user name, email, and password. The model is placed in the profiles app. To differentiate the information stored in the UserProfile model from the similar information stored in the Order model, the fields have the prefix default. Users can place an order without signing up for an account.<br>

The custom model field video_unlocked is a boolean field, used to detect if a registered user has purchased a video tutorial and has access the video's url in their user profile page on the website. The boolean field is triggered in the webhook handler in the checkout app.

**Relationship with Order and Contact models:** The UserProfile model establishes relationships with the models Order and Contact in app checkout and contact, respectively. This facilitates data retrieval and management of user contact information and purchase history.<br>

![ERD UserProfile](/documentation/erd-userprofile.png)

**Communication**

**Contact Form:** Users can contect the store owner using a contact form on the website. The form is placed in the contact app, and the model is used to store the form data. The contact form guides user through all necessary details for the store owner to make a detailled offer on a customized surfboard.<br> 

The form can just as easily be used to send a simple enquiry, feedback or a question to the store owner. <br>

The user receives a copy of the message by email and the store owner is notified by email of the new message. <br>

**Relationship with UserProfile model:** The Contact model establishes relationships with the UserProfile model in the app profiles (see ERD). This facilitates data retrieval of contact information to conveniently prefill the user's contact information in the form.

![ERD Contact Model](/documentation/erd-contact.png)

![ERD Contact Model CONSTANTS and ForeignKey](/documentation/erd-contact-constants-fk.png)

**About Us**

**About Us Page:** The About Us page contains information about the store owner and the website goal. The page is placed in the about app, and the model is used to store the page content.

**Custom Surfboard:** The Custom Surfboard page contains a collection of custom surfboards created by the store owner. The page is placed in the about app, and the model is used to store the page content. Although there is no entity relation between the models, the CustomSurfboard model enhances the Contact model, which aims to collect information from customers for a customized surfboard.

**FAQs:** The FAQs page contains frequently asked questions and answers. The page is placed in the about app, and the model is used to store the page content. Websites that include a FAQs page can enhance the credibility and authority of the website content, which search engines like Google value and thereby beneficial for SEO.

**Resources:** The Resources page contains links to reliable sources on environmental and ocean conservation. The page is placed in the about app, and the model is used to store the page content. Websites that include external links to reputable sources can enhance the credibility and authority of the website content, which search engines like Google value and thereby beneficial for SEO.

### Agile Development Methods (Epics, User Stories, MoSCoW Prioritization, Kanban board)

This project utilizes Agile Development Methods to manage development and ensure efficient delivery.

#### Epics 

These represent the high-level objectives and functionalities of the project. Each one can be further decomposed into smaller, more manageable tasks described in the user stories. The user stories can be viewed on [this projectâ€™s Kanban board](https://github.com/users/g-omarsdottir/projects/5).

#### User Stories

These detailed descriptions outline functionalities from the user's perspective. They follow the format "As a [role], I can [capability] so that [received benefit]". Each user story has well-defined acceptance criteria outlining the specific requirements for successful implementation. The user stories can be viewed on [this projectâ€™s Kanban board](https://github.com/users/g-omarsdottir/projects/5).

#### The MoSCoW Prioritization Method

To effectively manage resources and development flow, based on urgency and necessity, the prioritization method MoSCoW was employed. The acronym stands for Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. 

**Must Have:** Features absolutely essential for the current iteration's functionality and guaranteed to be delivered.<br>
**Should Have:** Desirable features that add significant value to the current iteration but can be reconsidered if needed.<br>
**Could Have:** Features that would be nice to have but can be deferred for later iterations without impacting core functionality.<br>
**Won't Have:** Features that are not a priority for the current iteration and are excluded from the current scope, possibly not implemented at all.<br>

This method is a structural approach to determine which features are essential for the current stage (Must Have), which can be incorporated if time allows (Should Have), which might be deferred for later iterations (Could Have), and which are excluded from this iteration or unlikely to be implemented (Wonâ€™t Have). The priorities are reflected with **labels** on each user story on [this projectâ€™s Kanban board](https://github.com/users/g-omarsdottir/projects/5).

#### Kanban Board for Visual Workflow Management

The Kanban board is a handy tool in agile project management to provide a clear visual representation of the project planning and development workflow. This board displays the various stages each work item progresses through, along with the current status of individual tasks. This projectâ€™s Kanban board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/g-omarsdottir/projects/5).

The project a custom HTML error page for status codes 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error) for improved user experience. The error page maintains a consistent design with the rest of the website. The error pages clearly explains the meaning of the error code in a user-friendly way avoiding technical jargon and uses clear, concise language. The error pages display a friendly image in line with the website theme to make the error page more visually appealing.<br>

To style the error pages during development, the error pages were rendered using temporary views and urls placed in the profile app for easy testing. The approach is documented in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

#### Discount Code

The discount code can be obtained by subscribing to the newsletter and for future features for campaigns. The discount code and the amount is displayed to the user in the shopping cart, and t. The user can remove the discount code, e.g. to enter a different discount code, if they wish to.

### Responsiveness

Full responsiveness was achieved using Bootstrap's grid system. The website is designed to be viewed on a desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile device.

### Security

#### User Authentication and Authorization

The application ensures secure user authentication and authorization through the integration of Django Allauth. This powerful tool simplifies the process of managing user accounts, including registration, login, password reset, and email verification. By utilizing Django Allauth, the project adheres to best practices for web application security, providing our users with a safe and reliable environment.

#### Access Control

To safeguard user data and privacy, stringent access controls were implemented . These measures are designed to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive information, ensuring that each user can only view or interact with their own content. 

#### Secure Payment Processing

For handling financial transactions, the project utilizes Stripe, a leading payment processing service. Stripe is renowned for its commitment to security, providing a seamless and secure way for users to make payments online. By integrating Stripe, all financial operations are ensured to be conducted in compliance with industry-standard security protocols, protecting both users and the store owner from potential threats.

In summary, the application prioritizes security at every level, from user account management to data protection and financial transactions simulation.

### Future Features

**Review & Rate Management:** As a future feature, the project envisions expansion to include a user-driven review and rating system for products. This enhancement aims to empower store owners with insights into customer preferences, identifying popular and less favored tutorials. Such information will facilitate strategic decisions regarding content expansion or refinement, ultimately guiding users towards making informed purchasing choices. <br>

While reviews and ratings are prevalent in ecommerce platforms, prioritizing this feature is beyond the current scope due to time limitations. The project's primary goal remains focused on raising awareness for ocean conservation efforts and showcasing the unique, custom-shaped surfboards crafted by the store owner. Given the distinct pricing challenges associated with custom-made products, these are not made available for purchase on the website. A review and rating system to enhance the platform incrementally is at the top list of future considerations.

## Web Marketing

### Ecommerce Business Model

The business model for this ecommerce website is a Business to Customer (B2C) model, currently only selling digital content for single one-time payments. <br>

This section elaborates on the ecommerce marketing value and SEO benefits of the projectâ€™s custom models.

The focus and main goal of this project is to create an ecommerce website with integrated purchase process and features that increase the marketing value and SEO benefits. The design of the technical architecture of the individual Django models was created to enhance web marketing efforts beyond the organic growth with social media marketing and reducing costs related to traditional advertising.

#### Products models

The Product model and related Category and Subcategory models ensure a coherent and consistent use of terminology regarding the surfboard parameters throughout the website. 

**Marketing Value:** Consistent use of terminology makes a trustworthy and serious impression. This avoids misspelling in the product description, thus avoiding concerns about the store ownerâ€™s expertise, which could potentially reduce the market value.

**SEO Benefits:** Using predefined parameters reduces the risk of misspelling while creating the entry for the product, potentially leading to failed searches in search engines or on the websiteâ€™s integrated search field.

#### Discount Code Model

**Marketing Value:** Discount codes incentivize users to subscribe to the newsletter, increasing brand awareness and potentially leading to repeat customers.

**SEO Benefits:** Discount codes can be promoted through social media and email marketing campaigns, driving traffic to the website.

#### Video Unlocked Field of the Profile model

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

The website design was planned with SEO in mind. This is described in detail in the relevant ERD models.

#### Keywords

The metadata for this project has been carefully crafted to enhance search engine optimization (SEO) and improve discoverability. The overall approach to keyword selection and implementation is as follows:

**Keyword Development Process**

1. **Initial Brainstorming with fellow surfers and my sister, Geographer and Specialist in Geothermal Energies **: We began with a comprehensive brainstorming session to identify relevant terms and concepts related to our surfboard tutorials and eco-friendly surfing products. This ensured targeting the most effective terms for the niche.

2. **Google Search Analysis**: Related searches and suggestions provided by Google for initial terms, which helped uncover additional relevant keywords and phrases.

3. **Professional Consultation**: We consulted with SEO professionals to refine our keyword list and 

4. **Long-Tail Keyword Focus**: Emphasizes is on long-tail keywords to target specific user intents and capture more qualified traffic. These longer, more specific phrases often have less competition and higher conversion rates.

5. **Keyword Diversity**: A mix of both short-tail and long-tail keywords to create a balanced and comprehensive SEO strategy.

### Implementation

- Keywords are strategically placed in meta descriptions, page titles, and content headers.
- A natural integration of keywords within the website content to maintain readability and user experience. Keywords were used in headings and in semantic and <strong> html tags.
- The metadata is structured to be both search engine friendly and informative to potential visitors.

#### Sitemap

[XML-Sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) was used to generate the sitemap for the deployed project. The generator crawls the entire website and generates a sitemap.xml file that was downloaded and placed in the rootdirectory of this project. The sitemap is an XML file that contains a list of all the pages on the website. The sitemap is used by search engines to crawl the website and index the pages.

#### Robots.txt

The robots.txt file is a text file that tells search engines how to crawl the website. The robots.txt file is located in the root directory of the website. The robots.txt file is used to disallow certain pages from crawling by search engines and are not indexed by search engines.

The [Sitemap for this project](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/details-shaping-sustainable-surf-8794b08a1b3a.herokuapp.com-da3dd3a88.html) is included in the robots.txt file.

In this project, the disallowed pages are the account pages and the shopping cart page.

The ownership of the robots.txt file is tested and verified by Google by adding a sitespecific metatag in the head of the base template. Google then veryfies if the robots.txt file is working correctly and provides a performance report after a short waiting time.

![ownership-verfied-html-tag](/documentation/testing/test-robots.txt.png)

### Privacy Policy

[Privacypolicygenerator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/) was used to create the privacy policy for this project.

The privacy policy is rendered on the websites template to make it visually more appealing and make trustworthy impression on users. The privacy policy is located in the home app and is anchored in the footer of the website.

**GDPR Compliance:** If a website collects personal data from European Union residents, compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is mandatory. A privacy policy is a key component of GDPR compliance, outlining how personal data is collected, processed, stored, and protected.
Trust Building: It builds trust with users by being transparent about what data is collected, how it's used, and for what purposes. 

**Riskmanagement:** In a real-life ecommerce project, having a clear privacy policy in place helps identify potential risks associated with data handling and processing. Addressing these risks proactively can prevent legal issues and reputational damage.
