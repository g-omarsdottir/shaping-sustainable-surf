### Colors

The website's colors are inspired by the ocean and the beach. The main color of the website is the blue #57a7b3 used in the website logo.

![colors](/documentation/colors.png)

A complimenting colorpalette with the website logo's color was created by [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/palette/57a7b3/3d757d/b35794/7d3d67/b3a357). To keep the overall layout sleek and avoiding visual clutter, the complementing colors were mainly used as accents in box-shadows and for pseudo-class hover effect.

The font color is a warm tone of black and background color is a lighter shade of the main color, which make a very good match for accessability, readability and contrast while being easy on the eye.

## Project planning

### Database Schema

This project leverages a serverless PostgreSQL database for efficient data management. A well-defined Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) (see below) was created upfront to guide development. This approach minimizes database complexity and streamlines the development process, reducing the need for future modifications and debugging. Each model within the project directly corresponds to a table in the ERD, ensuring a clear and consistent data structure.

#### Technical Architecture

**Technical Design:** Separation of concern was implemented by dividing key components into individual Django Models (see ERD). This allows for simple and reliable queries based on the primary key, as well as easy management and scalability.

Relationships between the model fields are indicated with relationship lines on the ERD.

**Model-Based Design:** The principles of separation of concerns are adhered to by employing distinct Django models for each key system component (see ERD). This promotes code clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

**Relational Data Modeling:** The ERD effectively visualizes the relationships between models and model fields, fostering the construction of streamlined and efficient database queries utilizing primary keys.

#### Key Features

**Product Management:** The custom models facilitate the storage and management of individual product entities in the products app.

Products are stored in one model. Categories and Subcategories are stored in separate models, which allows for scalability and streamlines further technical design. 

Choices for the Category and Subcategory models are defined as constants within the models. This guarantees consistent terminology throughout the application, enhancing user experience and simplifying search queries.

This approach simplifies the models for the shopping and purchase process, as well as allows for code consistency in code, by referring to products in all html template by the name product, while assuring a separation of concerns and explicitness.

Superusers (store owners) are granted comprehensive permissions within the application, allowing them to efficiently manage content across the platform. These permissions encompass creation, update, and deletion of product data, and pricing adjustments.

![ERD Product model](/documentation/erd-product.png)

**Ecommerce Functionality**

**Discount Codes:** The custom model facilitates the storage and management of individual discount codes in the cart app. The model is used to validate the code and apply the discount to the shopping cart. To ensure the code is valid, the model checks if the code is in the database, and if the code is in the database, if the code is currently active. As precaution, the model and the form are placed in the shopping cart app to allow the form to be submitted to check for validation without interfering with the order form in the checkout app.<br>

Superusers (store owners) are granted permission to create, update, and delete discount codes, as well as manage settings to activate or disable discount codes temporarily.

**Relationship with Order model:** The Order model includes a foreign key to the DiscountCode model, allowing for easy access to the discount code applied to the order.<br>

![ERD DiscountCode model](/documentation/erd-discount-code.png)

**Order Management:** The model Order stores all necessary information for a store order. The model OrderItem associates the products with orders. The models are placed in the checkout app<br>  

Superusers (store owners) are granted permission to view and add new orders, as well as editing essential order details post-purchase, including contact information, delivery addresses, and discounts applied. This flexibility is particularly useful for correcting errors or accommodating changes requested by customers.<br>

Non-Editable Order Items: For security and integrity, the individual items within each order are presented inline but are marked as read-only. This prevents accidental modifications to the items ordered.<br>

These extensive permissions empower superusers to maintain and optimize the application's functionality, ensuring smooth operations and customer satisfaction.

The model OrderItem associates the purchased products with orders. Furthermore, it stores the product name and price at the time of order in case of changes in product name, price or if a product is deleted to maintain data integrity of the order history. These values are passed to the model in the checkout view.

**Integrated Payment Processing:** The system facilitates secure online transactions for product purchases by integrating with Stripe, a payment gateway provider. This ensures a seamless and secure user experience during checkout.

**Relationship with Product, DiscountCode and UserProfile models:** The Order model establishes relationships with the models Product in app products, DiscountCode in app cart, and UserProfile in app profiles (see ERD). This facilitates data retrieval and management of purchase history for both users and store administrators.

![ERD checkout](/documentation/erd-checkout.png)

**Payment Security**

**Stripe Integration:** By leveraging Stripe's secure payment infrastructure, the application safeguards sensitive financial information during transactions. This ensures user trust and adheres to industry-standard security protocols.

**Data security Measures** 

**CSRF Protection:** To safeguard against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, the application enforces the use of CSRF tokens in all forms using the POST method. This bolsters data integrity and prevents unauthorized actions.

**User Management**

**Django Allauth Integration for User Management:** User authentication and authorization are implemented by leveraging the Django Allauth, a third-party library that upholds robust security practices. This provides a robust and secure foundation for user access control.

**UserProfile model:** The UserProfile model is used to store user data. This includes user name, email, and password. The model is placed in the profiles app. To differentiate the information stored in the UserProfile model from the similar information stored in the Order model, the fields have the prefix default. Users can place an order without signing up for an account.<br>

The custom model field video_unlocked is a boolean field, used to detect if a registered user has purchased a video tutorial and has access the video's url in their user profile page on the website. The boolean field is triggered in the webhook handler in the checkout app.

**Relationship with Order and Contact models:** The UserProfile model establishes relationships with the models Order and Contact in app checkout and contact, respectively. This facilitates data retrieval and management of user contact information and purchase history.<br>

![ERD UserProfile](/documentation/erd-userprofile.png)

**Communication**

**Contact Form:** Users can contect the store owner using a contact form on the website. The form is placed in the contact app, and the model is used to store the form data. The contact form guides user through all necessary details for the store owner to make a detailled offer on a customized surfboard.<br> 

The form can just as easily be used to send a simple enquiry, feedback or a question to the store owner. <br>

The user receives a copy of the message by email and the store owner is notified by email of the new message. <br>

**Relationship with UserProfile model:** The Contact model establishes relationships with the UserProfile model in the app profiles (see ERD). This facilitates data retrieval of contact information to conveniently prefill the user's contact information in the form.

### Agile Development Methods (Epics, User Stories, MoSCoW Prioritization, Kanban board)

This project utilizes Agile Development Methods to manage development and ensure efficient delivery.

#### Epics 

These represent the high-level objectives and functionalities of the project. Each one can be further decomposed into smaller, more manageable tasks described in the user stories. The user stories can be viewed on [this projectâ€™s Kanban board](https://github.com/users/g-omarsdottir/projects/5).

#### User Stories

These detailed descriptions outline functionalities from the user's perspective. They follow the format "As a [role], I can [capability] so that [received benefit]". Each user story has well-defined acceptance criteria outlining the specific requirements for successful implementation. The user stories can be viewed on [this projectâ€™s Kanban board](https://github.com/users/g-omarsdottir/projects/5).

#### The MoSCoW Prioritization Method

To effectively manage resources and development flow, based on urgency and necessity, the prioritization method MoSCoW was employed. The acronym stands for Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. 

**Must Have:** Features absolutely essential for the current iteration's functionality and guaranteed to be delivered.<br>
**Should Have:** Desirable features that add significant value to the current iteration but can be reconsidered if needed.<br>
**Could Have:** Features that would be nice to have but can be deferred for later iterations without impacting core functionality.<br>
**Won't Have:** Features that are not a priority for the current iteration and are excluded from the current scope, possibly not implemented at all.<br>

This method is a structural approach to determine which features are essential for the current stage (Must Have), which can be incorporated if time allows (Should Have), which might be deferred for later iterations (Could Have), and which are excluded from this iteration or unlikely to be implemented (Wonâ€™t Have). The priorities are reflected with **labels** on each user story on [this projectâ€™s Kanban board](https://github.com/users/g-omarsdottir/projects/5).

#### Kanban Board for Visual Workflow Management

The Kanban board is a handy tool in agile project management to provide a clear visual representation of the project planning and development workflow. This board displays the various stages each work item progresses through, along with the current status of individual tasks. This projectâ€™s Kanban board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/g-omarsdottir/projects/5).
